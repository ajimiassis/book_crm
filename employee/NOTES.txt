To create virtual environment
    py -m venv name(eg:myworld)

Then you have to activate the environment, by typing this command:
    myworld\Scripts\activate.bat

Note: You must activate the virtual environment every time you open the command prompt to work on your project.

Run the Django project
    py manage.py runserver

To create an app
    py manage.py startapp members

[CTRL] [C] to stop the server and you should be back in the virtual environment.
